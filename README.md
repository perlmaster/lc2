# lc2
my version of the old Berkley style lc command to list files according to category
this utility was written to compile under the C compiler on my 64 bit windows 10 system, but with a
few minor changes it should also compile on your system

lc2.c - main module
die.c - C version of the Perl die() function
system_error.c - display a system error message
quit.c - display a system error message and exit
format_number_with_commas.c - format an integer value into a printable string with commas
